    "Like most open source projects, NumPy has many open issues and pull requests that require developer attention, and not nearly enough developer-hours to address them all. Even the simple task of reading through the issues/PRs would take hours as there are on the order of 1000 open issues and ~200 open PR's for NumPy (as of 1/2020). Thus it might be worthwhile to attempt some sort of analysis to determine the relative *importance* of the open issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple idea would be to look at the number of times any given issue has been cross-referenced as a weak proxy for *importance*, i.e. how often is a particular concept referenced by other developers. A question like this seems like a good match for GitHub's new [GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/guides/intro-to-graphql/). Note the API is not really about building graphs but rather a different way of formulating queries of GitHub's data. Nevertheless the GraphQL API seems to be well-suited for the type of question we are interested in asking, as it is natural to think of issues as *nodes* and cross-references as *edges*."
